- As a user, I want to be able to login to the app so that I can access the create recipe form and my saved recipes. 
- Once logged in, I want to be presented with the option to either create a new recipe or view existing ones on the home page.

## ERD
The "Users" table would have fields for storing information about each user, such as a unique ID, name, email, password, etc.
The "Recipes" table would have fields for storing information about each recipe, such as a unique ID, name, ingredients, instructions, etc.
There would be a relationship between the "Users" and "Recipes" table, with a one-to-many relationship between a user and their recipes, meaning one user can have multiple recipes, but each recipe can only belong to one user.
